# EAJAs-Hours

Project management and hour tracking for businesses.

EAJAs Hours offers a professional UI design for employees to track their working hours on projects. This iOS app uses 
mongoDB realm as a backend database.

The Pod file is to large to commit, so the project will not run until pods are installed using the podfile. Additionally,
this app requires user authentication. The following test credentials should work:
email: X@gmail.com
password: 123456
